## About Code Samples

Code samples are tested using [byexamples](https://byexamples.github.io).

That's why they might look a bit uncommon, using `>>`, `..` and `=>` as prompt indicators.

They all use a common base setup to have some fake objects to work with:

```ruby
{% include 'docs_base.rb' without context %}
```

# Introduction

Teckel provides a common interface for wrapping your ruby business logic into,  
with enforced input, output and error data structures.

The two main components are [Operations](operations/basics) and [Chains](chains/basics).

## About Code Samples

Code samples are tested using [byexamples](https://byexamples.github.io).

They all use a common base setup to have some fake objects to work with:

```ruby
{% include 'docs_base.rb' without context %}
```
